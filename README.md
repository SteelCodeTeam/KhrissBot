## **Introducing KhrissBot! ✨📘**

KhrissBot is a public bot for the Spanish Discord Cosmere community. Several communities have participated in the different functionalities that have been implemented.

We recommend reading the work of Brandon Sanderson since the content of this bot is based on his work!

## **Final Notes 🚀**
We have plans to maintain the mod indefinitely, when it reaches its final version, we will not add new features very frequently, but we will fix bugs and errors.

Perhaps we can also translate the functionalities into other languages. These things always take time, **please be patient and give feedback in our discord.**
